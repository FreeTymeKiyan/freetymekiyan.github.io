<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A tragedy&nbsp;happened yesterday after I was about to finish problem set 5 for Communication Networks. I was intended to plot a figure using Matlab to clarify my solution, while just before that, it came to me that I didn&#39;t uninstall Macports on my macbook pro. I am a person who is really tight with my personal device, which means that anything not useful enough will be wiped out from my disk. It may sound crucial, but, you know, after a certain amount of time, computer will become slow because of this. That&#39;s why I maintain a good habit to remove softwares or documents as soon as I don&#39;t need them.&nbsp;</span></span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Then the tragedy happened. I opened CleanMyMac to do uninstall, but Macports was not there. Then I searched on google and found out that to do full uninstall a special way is needed. It needs to be done in Terminal with commands. I entered the first command to remove things installed by Macport. Nothing happened. Then I entered the second command, which was really long, and I accidentally typed one more space. The command is sudo rm -rf ~/.macports. I typed one more space between ./ and .macports. The result is obvious. All my documents under user folder were gone.&nbsp;</span></span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I sat there silently, looking at the screen. Actually, I was completly out of my mind. Some really really important files were there, including my course materials and code, my career folder with resumes and demos, and a bunch of ebooks and projects. I felt like a part of my heart was gone. This coming week would be extremely busy, but I still made this kind of mistake. Oh my god, why do I have to suffer this kind of misfortune in my life?</span></span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I tried hard to find those files back using recovery softwares, but in vain. It scanned my disk for the whole night, recovered nothing but 60GB of shit. Almost all the data recovered was useless, can you believe it? All my preferences were gone, my projects which didn&#39;t sync to Github were gone, my documents were gone, my collection of ebooks were gone. All of them were gone...</span></span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That was a great amount of loss, but nobody really can feel it&#39;s value. It&#39;s like a joke to others rather than something needs to be comforted. Or, it&#39;s like something they feel pityful but can do nothing about it. Yeah, that&#39;s definitely true, because I can do nothing about it as well.</span></span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I spent some time to recover those things on the Internet today. Now it&#39;s functioning well although some important&nbsp;projects were gone.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">My luck is saved for tomorrow&#39;s career fair and the coming break. I went to career fair twice already, received a bunch of interviews, but got no offer. None. I&#39;ve never imagined that finding an internship as an international student can be so hard. Anyways, I may have over-estimated my ability, which I felt like under-estimated by companies and recruiters. All I want to do is to write it out to express my upset and disappointment for the reality. But certainly, it can&#39;t stop me.&nbsp;I will fight to the end to get an desirable internship, no matter what is the cost.</span></span></span></span>
