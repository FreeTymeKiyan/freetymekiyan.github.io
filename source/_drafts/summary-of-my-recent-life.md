<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It&#39;s been some time since I came to the U.S on August 26th, 2013, roughly two months. I&#39;ve always been thinking about spending some time on writing a summary of these days recently. Seems that I&#39;ve already thought of it for a month. Well, I finally got some time today and decide to write something.</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It&#39;s already November 6th, 2013 and my first&nbsp;quarter at RHIT is almost done. Recalling the goals I made before pursuing master&#39;s degree, I feel humble and nervous because of my not that strong execution. Here are the goals I set for myself:&nbsp;</span></span>

1.  <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">study hard</span></span>
2.  <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">keep fit</span></span>
3.  <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">communicate with close friends</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Consider all the things I&#39;ve done, I may have deviated a little bit from these goals.</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">For the first goal, I did really study hard, but I am certain that I didn&#39;t try my best. In fact, I found that I never do my best on my study.&nbsp;I didn&#39;t make study my first priority, although it&#39;s absolutely one of my highest priorities.&nbsp;Sometimes I&#39;ll put it off a little bit because of hanging out with my friends or other stuffs like that and stayed up late before the deadline. Then I would be out of spirit the next day and concentrate poorly, or even sleep in the class. To improve, I think I have to be more firm on the first priority of it. If I could have spare time after study, then I would be able to arrange it freely.&nbsp;I believe I&nbsp;can do better, there is still much space to improve. But before that, I should get straight A first for this quarter.</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">The second goal is to keep fit. Well, indeed, I didn&#39;t gain any weight. I managed to keep&nbsp;140 pounds, that is around 63.5 kg. But my goal is to gain more muscle and be muscular. Yeah, that&#39;s what I want desperately. For the first few weeks, I enjoyed the food here a lot and eat much more than usual. Now I&#39;m consciously controlling my appetite and trying to eat less. Also, I spend more time on workout like swimming, running, bicycling&nbsp;and etc. These aerobic sports will certainly help me lose more weight. Maybe some muscle as well. It&#39;s okay.&nbsp;My recent goal is to lose 10 pounds more weight&nbsp;first and after that,&nbsp;gain more muscle. I&#39;ll achieve it. To further clarify this goal, I&#39;ll change it to lose 10 pounds and be muscular after that.</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">I keep talking a lot with old friends the first few days after my arriving. Then I&#39;ve got some new friends and contact with old ones much less.&nbsp;That&#39;s not very good, I guess, because I still cherish the connection between me and them. It&#39;s really fortunate to meet Dr. Song, Auntie Jiang, Auntie Pauline and other elders of the Terre Hault Chinese family.&nbsp;It would have been really hard for any newly come students&nbsp;without their assistance. I respect them and&nbsp;cherish the relationship between us.&nbsp;And&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">I might be too&nbsp;anxious for the lastest&nbsp;social activities, which I can feel clearly</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">. I&#39;ve always been like this, I know, </span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">not only in RHIT, but also when I was&nbsp;an undergraduate, in high school and middle school. I&#39;ll be very willing to play and develop new friendship with others&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">after changing into a new environment and lose balance a little bit because of playing too much</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">.</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;I do care about my friends. That won&#39;t change a bit. But I have to learn how to manage my time with them rationally from now on. I guess it would be</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;better to make our parties or get-together more regular.</span></span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:14px;">One more thing that should be mentioned is skill practising. I used to be a very good programmer, at least I think I am. But I do much less programming after being here. I spend a lot of time centering on my courses, but not all the courses are beneficial to my skill. Some of them even have no relation to it. The core principle for me is to keep pace with courses while pay enough attention on programming in my spare time, because that would probably be my career in the future. I&#39;ll choose more courses which are more relevant to coding.&nbsp;Courses that are not that relevant also need to be studied to get good grades, as long as GPA plays an important role in job-hunting.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 14px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 1.6em;">And I should learn&nbsp;some lessons after the interview of microsoft and the career fair last time. One thing is that I need to wear formally and speak more native English&nbsp;to leave them a good impression. The other thing is that I&#39;m still not able enough on coding and some basic knowledge of computer science. I definitly need more practice and experience before getting a job from big tech companies, namely Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google and etc. That is my ultimate goal after graduation.</span>

	<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">All of the thoughts above are the summary of my recent life. I&#39;m aware of my short-comings and able to undertake reflection. Then I shall get them done.&nbsp;</span></span></span>
