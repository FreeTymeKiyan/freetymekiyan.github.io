	To newlyweds and entrepreneurs: A speech equally suitable for both!

	致新人和创业者们：一个同样适用两者的演讲！

	[Speech delivered at one of my co-founders' wedding.]

	【在我合伙人之一婚礼上的致辞】

	![](http://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/6/000/1bd/1cf/25bc29c.png)I am pleased to witness the entrepreneurial vowels of co-founders ZH and SS.&nbsp; As an angel investor in ZH and SS, I hereby recite my investment memo in their matrimony.

	今天我很高兴见证合伙人肇辉和莎莎的创业誓言。作为他们的天使投资人，我在此宣读对他们婚姻的投资协议。

	Getting married is a lot like starting a company.&nbsp; This kind of commitment requires similar aspirations, goals, values, and affinity for each other.&nbsp; In the past few years, ZH and SS were almost inseparable, and all of us feel their were made for each other.

	结婚和创立公司非常相像。这种承诺需要相似的壮志，目标，价值观和互相的吸引力。在过去几年中，肇辉和莎莎几乎是形影不离的，我们所有人都觉得他们是天生一对。

	Just being a good fit is far from enough, good co-founders need to fully tolerate and trust each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without trust and tolerance, even superstar co-founders (like Apple and Microsoft&rsquo;s co-founders) may not stay together.&nbsp; So my advice for ZH: whenever you have a disagreement, she should decide the little issues, and you can decide the big issues.&nbsp; What issues are big?&nbsp; Well, if you love each other, nothing is a big deal.&nbsp; And my advice for SS: there should be equality between men and women.&nbsp; So whenever you agree with each other, you make the call.&nbsp; And whenever you disagree with each other, he makes the call.&nbsp; This commitment will bind you forever with each other.

	仅仅是合适还远远不够，好的合伙人需要完全地相互容忍和信任。没有信任和容忍，即便是超级明星合伙人（像苹果和微软的合伙人）也可能不会一直在一起。所以我给肇辉的建议是：你们有分歧的时候，小事归她管，大事你来定。什么是大事呢？好吧，如果你们彼此相爱，就没有什么大不了的事。我给莎莎的建议是：男人和女人之间要有平等。所以当你们意见相同时，你听他的。你们意见不同时，他听你的。这一承诺将让你们永远紧密相连。

	Marriage and entrepreneurship both require passion.&nbsp; Good entrepreneurs need to be deeply in love with their products.&nbsp; I hope you will love each other like great entrepreneurs love their products, like the way Steve Jobs loves Apple &ndash; every speech he gives about Apple is full of love.&nbsp; Just like Steve, never let anyone attack your love.&nbsp; If they do, do what Steve would do: launch thermonuclear war on them!

	婚姻和创业都需要热情。好的创业者需要深深热爱他们的产品。我希望你们会像伟大的创业者热爱产品那样爱护彼此，像斯蒂夫&middot;乔布斯爱苹果那样 - 他对苹果的每段演讲都充满了爱。就像斯蒂夫那样，绝不要让任何人诋毁你的挚爱。如果有人敢这么做，像斯蒂夫做的那样：向他们发动热核战争！

	Good husbands, wives, and entrepreneurs are committed dedicated, and detail-oriented.&nbsp; ZH and SS: You both have enviable jobs, but you must devote enough quality time to each other.&nbsp; ZH: reduce your work hours, don&rsquo;t go drinking every weekend.&nbsp; Your poetry cannot stop with the ceremony.&nbsp; Every year, you owe your lovely bride three poems, on her birthday, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and your anniversary.&nbsp; SS: As your job takes you around the world, make sure you &ldquo;wechat&rdquo; with your handsome groom.&nbsp; Bring him a present from every country, and make sure you snuggle with him when you return.&nbsp; ZH may want people to think he is tough, but he has a delicate heart, and cares about every drop of detail in what you do for him.

	好丈夫，好妻子和创业者们是坚定的，专注的和注重细节的。肇辉和莎莎：你们俩都有令人艳羡的工作，但你们得给彼此留出一些优质时间。肇辉：减少你的工作时间，不要每个周末都去喝酒。你的诗情画意不能随着婚礼一块消失了。每一年，你都欠你可爱的新娘三首诗，在她生日，情人节和你们纪念日的这几天。莎莎：由于你的工作让你满世界跑，确保你和你帅气的新浪通&rdquo;微信&ldquo;。从每个国家给他带份礼物，还得保证回来的时候和他紧紧相拥。肇辉也许希望人们觉得他坚强，但他有一颗易碎的心，关注你为他所做的每个点滴细节。

	As ZH&rsquo;s 10-year friend, I am able to author and sign a great due-diligence report, guaranteeing that he is your bluechip.&nbsp; As your angel investor, I am willing to offer an unprecedented reverse hedge, guaranteeing the happiness of this marriage.

	作为肇辉十年的朋友，我可以起草并签署一份非常尽职的报告，保证他是你的蓝筹股。作为你们的天使投资人，我愿意提出一份史无前例的对赌协议，保证这桩婚事幸福美满。

	Today&rsquo;s beautiful founding is just the beginning.&nbsp; In a few years, I anticipate an IPO, the birth of a new company.&nbsp; An your IPO party, I look forward to holding in my hand the fruit of your love.

	今天美妙的创立只是一个开始。几年之内，我期待一次IPO，一个新公司的诞生。在你们的IPO聚会上，我希望见证你们爱情的结晶。
