#Unable to move quickly in line.  

In Vim, we can move quickly in line using "f" or "F" command. I know that's increasive search(control + s) in TextMate. But it's not that handy. For example, if we want to move to next "t" in the document, we need to press control + s, then click t. After that, next "t" is chosen, but we can't modify it straight at once. What we have to do is press esc or enter one more time and exit increasive search mode. And that's not handy at all. Correct me if I'm wrong. 

##Workaround

option + left/right, jump between words.

command + l, jump to line:column. This function should be improved. Why can't I just enter ":colNum" to jump to the exact column I want of the current line?
