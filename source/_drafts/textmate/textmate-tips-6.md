#Unable to move quickly in line.

In Vim, we can move quickly in line using "f" or "F" command.

##Workaround

option + left/right, jump between words.

command + l, jump to line:column. This function should be improved. Why can't I just enter ":colNum" to jump to the exact column I want of the current line?
