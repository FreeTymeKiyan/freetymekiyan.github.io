##Review

Let me start my summary on intern with a brief review. Start from 1st June, end on 1st August. Exactly two months.

1. Started Node.js with the book "Node Up and Running".
2. Began to use Textmate.
3. Built my first project: dashboard.
4. Learned about different neat modules, async, lodash, express, request...
5. Built my second project: gump.
6. Learned about static&unit testing. Able to set node automatic test and continuous integration myself.
7. Built sitemap web page for design.
8. Built a script to convert invoice to csv file.

Had a log for each day I spent here. A log consists of three sections: today, tomorrow and improvements.
