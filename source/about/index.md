Hi there! 

My name is Yang Liu. 

I blog about coding and life. 

I used to have a wordpress blog for years to keep tracking of my thoughts about technology and life, as well as the books I read, the music I love, and the movies I watch. It's been some time since I last updated it, because of my busy school work. But I know clearly in my heart, I love blogging, I want to share.
