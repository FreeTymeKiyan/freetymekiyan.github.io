An old series of translation articles are migrated from Wordpress to my new hexo blog. This series contains 23 articles which were translated after I graduated from university. 

Recently I have been working on the migration and update of these articles. Some words and sentences seem to be strange to me after a second look. So I did some necessary improvements. 

* Re-translated some lines
* Fixed formats 
* Fixed typos
  
Now these translations should be way much better than they were, I even had my girlfriend proofread every sentence. Special thanks to her for her patience and love! But certainly we are not able to find all improper lines. You are very welcome to notify me about it. Write some comments under whichever post or find me at those social networks, both would be great!
