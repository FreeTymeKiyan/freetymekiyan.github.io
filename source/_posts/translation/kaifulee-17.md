This year's Black Friday in the United States is on November 25, 2012, marking the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Techcrunch [reports](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/25/e-commerce-spending-on-black-friday-tops-1b-for-the-first-time-amazon-is-the-most-visited-retailer/) e-commerce spending of over a billion dollars. How did the Chinese shoppers do?
>美国今年的黑色星期五是在十一月二十五号，标志着圣诞采购季的开始。Techcrunch<sup>[[1]](#Reference)</sup>报道说电商的开销超过了十亿美元。那中国的消费者做得怎么样呢？

Well, the Chinese do not celebrate Thanksgiving, but instead had its "Black Friday" on November 11, the "Single Day", where young single people bought gifts to each other. Led by Alibaba's Tmall, Chinese e-commerce companies seized this opportunity, as 77.5% percent of online retailers announced their promotional programs on Singles' Day. On November 11, 2012, the total online sales revenue is estimated to be a whopping 30 billion yuan (4.84 billion US dollar) in just one day!
>好吧，中国人不过感恩节，但取而代之的是在十一月十一号的“黑色星期五”，光棍节，在那天单身的年轻人会互相赠送礼物。在阿里巴巴天猫商城的带领下，中国的电商公司抓住了这个机会，百分之七十七点五的在线零售商在光棍节这天宣布了他们的促销活动。二零一二年十一月十一号这天，总的在线销售利润估计在一天内就高达三百亿元（48.4亿美元）。

China has the world's largest population of Internet users. This phenomenal "Black Friday" number shows Chinese users are now ready to leap ahead as big spenders too!
>中国有世界上最多的网民。这不寻常的“黑色星期五”数字显示出中国的网民现在也已经准备好飞身向前成为购物狂人了！
