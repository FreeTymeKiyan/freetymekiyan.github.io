[Speech delivered at one of my co-founders' wedding.]
>【在我合伙人之一婚礼上的致辞。】

I am pleased to witness the entrepreneurial vowels of co-founders ZH and SS. As an angel investor in ZH and SS, I hereby recite my investment memo in their matrimony.
>今天我很高兴见证合伙人肇辉和莎莎的创业誓言。作为他们的天使投资人，我在此宣读对他们婚姻的投资协议。

Getting married is a lot like starting a company. This kind of commitment requires similar aspirations, goals, values, and affinity for each other. In the past few years, ZH and SS were almost inseparable, and all of us feel their were made for each other.
>结婚和创立公司非常相像。这种承诺需要类似的雄心壮志，目标，价值观和互相的吸引力。在过去几年中，肇辉和莎莎几乎是形影不离的，我们所有人都觉得他们是天生一对。

Just being a good fit is far from enough, good co-founders need to fully tolerate and trust each other. Without trust and tolerance, even superstar co-founders (like Apple and Microsoft's co-founders) may not stay together. So my advice for ZH: whenever you have a disagreement, she should decide the little issues, and you can decide the big issues. What issues are big? Well, if you love each other, nothing is a big deal. And my advice for SS: there should be equality between men and women. So whenever you agree with each other, you make the call. And whenever you disagree with each other, he makes the call. This commitment will bind you forever with each other.
>仅仅是合适还远远不够，好的合伙人需要完全地相互容忍和信任。没有信任和容忍，即便是超级明星合伙人（像苹果和微软的合伙人）也可能不会一直在一起。所以我给肇辉的建议是：你们有分歧的时候，小事归她管，大事你来定。什么是大事呢？好吧，如果你们彼此相爱，就没有什么大事了。我给莎莎的建议是：男人和女人之间要有平等。所以当你们意见相同时，你听他的。你们意见不同时，他听你的。这一承诺将让你们永远紧密相连。

Marriage and entrepreneurship both require passion. Good entrepreneurs need to be deeply in love with their products. I hope you will love each other like great entrepreneurs love their products, like the way Steve Jobs loves Apple - every speech he gives about Apple is full of love. Just like Steve, never let anyone attack your love. If they do, do what Steve would do: launch thermonuclear war on them!
>婚姻和创业都需要热情。好的创业者需要深深热爱他们的产品。我希望你们会像伟大的创业者热爱产品那样爱护彼此，像斯蒂夫·乔布斯爱苹果那样 - 他对苹果的每段演讲都充满了爱。就像斯蒂夫那样，绝不要让任何人诋毁你的挚爱。如果有人敢这么做，像斯蒂夫做的那样：向他们发动热核战争！

Good husbands, wives, and entrepreneurs are committed dedicated, and detail-oriented. ZH and SS: You both have enviable jobs, but you must devote enough quality time to each other. ZH: reduce your work hours, don't go drinking every weekend. Your poetry cannot stop with the ceremony. Every year, you owe your lovely bride three poems, on her birthday, Valentine's Day, and your anniversary. SS: As your job takes you around the world, make sure you ”wechat“ with your handsome groom. Bring him a present from every country, and make sure you snuggle with him when you return. ZH may want people to think he is tough, but he has a delicate heart, and cares about every drop of detail in what you do for him.
>好丈夫，好妻子和创业者们是坚定，专注和注重细节的。肇辉和莎莎：你们俩都有令人艳羡的工作，但你们得给彼此留出一些优质时间。肇辉：减少你的工作时间，不要每个周末都去喝酒。你的诗情画意不能随着婚礼一块消失了。每一年，你都欠你可爱的新娘三首诗，分别在她生日，情人节和你们纪念日的这几天。莎莎：由于你的工作让你满世界跑，确保你和你帅气的新郎互通“微信”。从每个国家给他带份礼物，还得保证回来的时候和他紧紧相拥。肇辉也许希望人们觉得他坚强，但他有一颗易碎的心，他关注你为他所做的每个点滴细节。

As ZH's 10-year friend, I am able to author and sign a great due-diligence report, guaranteeing that he is your bluechip. As your angel investor, I am willing to offer an unprecedented reverse hedge, guaranteeing the happiness of this marriage.
>作为肇辉十年的朋友，我可以起草并签署一份非常尽职的报告，保证他是你的蓝筹股。作为你们的天使投资人，我愿意提出一份史无前例的对赌协议，保证这桩婚事幸福美满。

Today's beautiful founding is just the beginning. In a few years, I anticipate an IPO, the birth of a new company. An your IPO party, I look forward to holding in my hand the fruit of your love.
>今天美妙的创立只是一个开始。几年之内，我期待一次IPO，一个新公司的诞生。在你们的IPO聚会上，我希望见证你们爱情的结晶。
