So, I continued the journey on learning about System Design and found another very good resource. It is a talk by Jeff Dean at Stanford named *Software Engineering Advice from Building Large-Scale Distributed Systems*.   
  
In this talk, Jeff Dean shared the lessons and tips learned from his various kinds of experience.  
  
One important skill he pointed out in the talk is the ability to estimate performance of a system design. Why is it important? Because this skill actually allows you to choose the "best" solution, according to the problem definition and the meaning of "best", without building it.   
  
Some fundamental knowledge is required for this ability:  
  
1. Numbers
2. Decomposition
  
The time cost for basic steps.  
  
Decompose a design into these basic steps.   
  
For example,
