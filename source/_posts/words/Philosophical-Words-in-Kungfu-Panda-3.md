My wife and I just watched Kungfu Panda 3 last weekend. Besides the fun parts, there are some words in it that I know they are right, but don’t fully understand. Maybe you feel the same. Here are a list of them. 

## Words
### 1
你何时才能领悟 索取越多 收获越少
When will you realize, the more you take, the less you have.

### 2
如果你只做你力所能及的事 你就没法进步
If you only do what you can do you'll never be more than you are now.

### 3
你连自己是谁都不知道
You don't even know who you are.
你说啥 我当然知道 我是神龙大侠
What do you....? Of course I do. I'm the Dragon Warrior.
那神龙大侠究竟意味着什么呢
And what exactly does that mean Dragon Warrior?
意味着...我要四处闯荡 拳打脚踢
It means...you know... just going around and punching and kicking
保卫家园什么的
Defending the valley and stuff.
拳打脚踢
Punching and kicking?
你认为这就是乌龟大师看中你的原因吗
You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?
一个五百年的预言选中了你
A five hundred year prophecy full-filled
难道就是让你耍耍花拳绣腿
so you can spend your days...
满镇子乱跑跟兔子耍帅吗
Kicking butt? And running through town high-fiving bunnies?

### 4
乌龟曾在一个山洞里打坐整整三十年
Oogway sat alone in a cave for thirty years
只为弄清一个问题
asking one question
我是谁
Who am I?

### 5
我没让你变成我这样
I'm not trying to turn you into me.
我是让你变成你自己
I'm trying to turn you into you.

### 6
但你们不必像我
But you don't have to be.
师父当初就是这个意思 我不必把你们变成另一个我
That's what Shifu meant. I don't have to turn you into me.
我要做的是激发你们自身的潜能
I have to turn you into you!

### 7
伙计们 展现出自己最好的水平就是你们真正的优势
You guys, your real strength comes from being the best you you can be.
那么 你是谁 你擅长什么
So, who are you? What are you good at?
你热衷什么 何为你的个人特色
What do you love? What makes you you?

### 8
我们初次见面的那一天
On the first day we met...
我看到了功夫的未来
I saw the future of kung fu.
也看到了过往
And the past.
我看到了那只能将两者合二为一的熊猫
I saw the panda who could unite them both.
这就是我选你的原因 阿宝
That is why I chose you, Po.
你结合了阴阳两极
Both sides of the Yin and Yang.
也是我真正的继承者
And my true successor.

## Summary

Try to dive into these words and think. Think about who I am, how I can become better me, how I can help others find themselves and become better themselves. Find the real self first, then forget it and just be it. More importantly, how to combine the two sides of things, negate nothing, exlude nothing.
