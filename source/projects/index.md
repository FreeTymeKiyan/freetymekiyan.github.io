2. #[DotRun][2]
  ##Introduction
  DotRun is a game inspired by someone in Rose-Hulman's CS lab. I first built it on BeagleBone Black with two buttons. Then I thought it would be cool if I can migrate it to iPhone and have gravity control.
  ##Versions
  BeagleBone Black
  iOS
3. #[Personal Blog][3]
  I used to have a wordpress blog. Some pages were read more than 1000 times.
  Now I migrated all my stuff to hexo. You are looking at it, so there is no need for a link.
4. #[Dashboard][4]
  Shows the global statistics of server.
5. #[Gump][5]
  CLI script runner which can ping all the hosts from a configuration file asynchronously and generate a formatted report.
